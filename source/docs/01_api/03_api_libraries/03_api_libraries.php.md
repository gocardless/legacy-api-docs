# PHP Library

We strongly encourage use of our official libraries for accessing the GoCardless API. Our official libraries are listed below, as well as community supported libraries.

### Getting the library

Install from source:

	git clone git@github.com:gocardless/gocardless-php.git

or install from tarball:

	curl -L https://github.com/downloads/gocardless/gocardless-php/gocardless-php-v0.4.1.tgz | tar xzv

Check out our [PHP docs](/php) or view [source on Github](https://github.com/gocardless/gocardless-php).


### Community libraries

Please note: the GoCardless developer docs are not relevant when installing these libraries. GoCardless is also unable to provide support for any community built libraries.
